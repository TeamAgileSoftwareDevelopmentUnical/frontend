## How to run the project.
First of all, clone both the frontend and the [backend](https://github.com/TeamAgileSoftwareDevelopmentUnical/backend) repositories.\
For the frontend part we suggest to open it with Visual Studio Code.\
Then install some `npm packages` running the following code line in the terminal:
```
npm install
```
_You can check all the dependencies in the file `package.json`._\
After the installation, you can execute the project running in the root folder this instruction:
```
npm start
```
Then, wait untill the browser will start.\

==Pay attention that, for security reasons, the mail API keys are not included here on GitHub.==
We can give you the configuration file if you want to test the mail support.\
In the `README.md` file of the other repository you can find all the backend instructions.

Once your browser will start, the home page will appear.

You can do the registration as a Customer or as a Seller, then do the login.\
If you are a Customer you will redirect to the Store Page.
