## How to run the project.
First of all, clone both the frontend and the [backend](https://github.com/TeamAgileSoftwareDevelopmentUnical/backend) repositories.\
For the frontend part we suggest to open it with Visual Studio Code.\
Then install some `npm packages` running the following code lines in the terminal:\

Angular Packages
```
npm install angular/cli
```
Ionic Packages
```
npm install ionic/cli
```
Phaser Packages
```
npm install phaser
```
Mail sender Packages
```
npm install googleapis nodemailer express
```

In the `README.md` file of the other repository you can find all the backend instruction.
